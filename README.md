## General Information
Basis the dataset, we analyze what factors affect the bike sharing usage. The target variable, bike sharing usage, and other parameters such as climate, day of the week, month of the year, type of user, etc. have been included in the dataset. We visualize the data, scale it and build a model to predict the bike sharing usage.

## Conclusions
We observe that certain months and weekends have more demand.
